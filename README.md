## Blood Cancer Detection
 
##### Domain : Deep Learning
##### Coding Language : Python 
##### IDE : Google Colab 
##### Database :	Dropbox
##### Freamwork : SKlearn , Tensorflow , Keras
##### Algorithm : Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
##### Description : This project helps us to give a Cancer detection system that could help to analyze the patient very quickly and easy way. We all know that cancer is a very crucial decrease. This model helps in a medical's Healthcare system for preliminary diagnosis. This project can be used for any other cancer detection of cancer. today we going to build a project for blood cancer but in the future, we will be executing other cancer detection projects also.
